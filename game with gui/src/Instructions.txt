Try to find your way through the cave system to collect the treasure and make it to the exit.
Within the cave system there are: a number of bottomless pits, one Wumpus, a number of Superbats, one treasure chest and one exit.
- A Wumpus is very smelly. If you are in an adjacent cave to a Wumpus, you will smell it.
- If you are in an adjacent cave to a pit, you will feel a breeze.
- If you are in an adjacent cave to the treasure, you will see the treasure glittering.
- If you are picked up by a Superbat, you will be moved to a random position in the cave system.
On each move you can choose to move (m) or shoot (s). Use the wsad keys to choose the direction of your movement or shot.
